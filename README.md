# The Superhero Universe

** Project Description **

A web app where you can find more than 700 characters from Marvel, DC, Star Wars, etc...

** Starting Point **

Continue to learn vue.js. Now on my own. Learned a lot with the Weather-app. Now trying to challenge myself with different problems and features.

** The MVP for this web application: **

Display the heroes(photo and name) by search;
Click on the image and it will display the specifications of the hero(in development);
Stylizitation (CSS) accordingly with what I wanted(in development).

** Development **

My goal here is to challenge what I've learned with vue.js. I came across with a CORS policy problem, which gave me a lot a of headaches, but it's solved. Now I'm trying to develop the functionality of showing a different views(the main & the description of the hero you select).

** New features: **
A Menu, where you can find a group of heroes by universe(f.e. Marvel, DC, Star Wars, Dark Horse, etc...)

** Tech & Methodologies **

CSS | HTML | vue.js | JavaScript | npm | VSCode | Vetur | REST
